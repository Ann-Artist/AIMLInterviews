# AIMLInterviews MCP Server

`aimlinterviews-mcp` turns MCP-compatible AI assistants into interview coaches backed by the local [AIMLInterviews](https://github.com/alirezadir/AIMLInterviews) curriculum.

It discovers practice problems, provides progressive hints, reviews candidate answers, and builds role- or company-focused preparation plans. The tutor follows a no-spoilers policy: problem retrieval excludes reference answers, hints provide progressively deeper process guidance, and answer review never executes submitted code.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- A local clone of the AIMLInterviews repository
- An MCP-compatible client such as Claude Code or Codex

## Quick start

Clone the repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alirezadir/AIMLInterviews.git
cd AIMLInterviews
```

Then connect the tutor from the repository directory.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add aimlinterviews -- npx -y aimlinterviews-mcp
```

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add aimlinterviews -- npx -y aimlinterviews-mcp
```

The server searches its working directory and parent directories for the clone. For clients launched elsewhere, configure the repository path explicitly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aimlinterviews": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "aimlinterviews-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AIMLINTERVIEWS_ROOT": "/path/to/your/AIMLInterviews/clone"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`AIMLINTERVIEWS_ROOT` must point to the repository root that contains `README.md` and `src/`.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_server_status` | Show the repository root, source commit, and catalog counts |
| `list_problems` | Filter practice problems by area, difficulty, tag, company mention, or query |
| `get_problem` | Retrieve a prompt and source metadata without its answer |
| `get_hint` | Request spoiler-safe hints at levels 1, 2, and 3 |
| `search_curriculum` | Find relevant chapter sections and source locations |
| `get_learning_path` | Build a role- and experience-based study sequence |
| `get_company_prep` | Build a role-based company preparation plan |
| `review_answer` | Review reasoning against an interview rubric without executing code |

The server also provides the `interview_tutor`, `mock_interview`, and `study_plan` prompts, plus `aimlinterviews://catalog` and `aimlinterviews://tutor-policy` resources.

## Content and safety model

- The server reads public Markdown under `src/`; it does not bundle a duplicate question bank.
- Stable catalog IDs are derived from the source path and title.
- Every problem and section includes its source path, line, and Git commit.
- Repository reads are path-confined, size-limited, and skip symbolic links.
- Company plans are curriculum-based role recommendations, not claims about private or current company interview questions.
- Candidate code is treated as text and is never executed.
- MCP protocol messages use stdout; diagnostics use stderr.

Restart the MCP client after pulling curriculum updates so the server rebuilds its in-memory catalog.

## Development

```bash
cd MCP
npm install
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
```

Run the compiled server directly:

```bash
AIMLINTERVIEWS_ROOT="$(cd .. && pwd)" npm start
```

Inspect it interactively:

```bash
npm run inspect
```

Publishing requires npm access to the `aimlinterviews-mcp` package:

```bash
npm login
npm publish --access public
```

## Design reference

The tool categories and tutor workflow were informed by the [TorchLeet MCP server](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet/tree/main/mcp-server). This implementation is original and reads the AIMLInterviews curriculum rather than copying TorchLeet content.
